		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			In our previous study, we have done detailed analysis for basic operations of the red-black tree based on the traditional sequential algorithm. In this project, I am going to apply parallel algorithm to implement red-black treeâ€˜s operations, search and insertion. And I will compare the performance of search and insertion operations for lock-based and lock-free parallel algorithms. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The red-black tree is a balanced binary search tree with height O(log <i>n</i>), and efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, which makes it a better choice than regular binary search in search-intensive applications. And it only requires few rotations to rebalance the tree and keep it red-black properties.

		<h2>Parallel Algorithm</h2>
			<p>
				<i>"A parallel algorithm, as opposed to a traditional sequential algorithm, is an algorithm which can be executed a piece at a time on many different processing devices, and then combined together again at the end to get the correct result."</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				People usually build cost-effective parallel algorithms by defining multiple operations on each step to improve the performance of traditional sequential algorithm, which specifies a sequence of operations and each step does one operation.
			</p>
			<h3>Lock-Based Algorithm</h3>
				<p>
					<i>"A lock or mutex (from mutual exclusion) is a synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource in an environment where there are many threads of execution."</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Lock-based parallel algorithms are usually implemented on the parallel random-access machine (PRAM), which is a shared-memory model of parallel computation that consists of a collection of identical processors and a shared memory. There are four types of PRAM.
					<ul>
		  				<li><b>EREW (exclusive read exclusive write)</b></li>
		  				Conccurents are not allowed to read and write to the same memory location at the same time.
		  				<li><b>CREW (concurrent read exclusive write)</b></li>
		  				Conccurents can only read a memory location.
		  				<li><b>CRCW (concurrent read concurrent write)</b></li>
		  				Concurrents allows both concurrent reads and concurrent writes to a memory location
		  				<li><b>ERCW (Exclusive read concurrent write)</b></li>
		  				This case is usually not considered.
					</ul>
